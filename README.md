# Module 4 Assignment – JavaScript Greeting Logic

This project loops through a list of names and prints either "Hello" or "Good Bye" based on the first letter of each name.

## How It Works
- Names starting with 'J' or 'j' → `Good Bye`
- All other names → `Hello`

## Files Included
- `index.html`
- `script.js`
- `SpeakHello.js`
- `SpeakGoodBye.js`
